Web App: Whats That?

Languages used: Ruby

Database: Postgres

This is a CRUD Web App designed for users to login and post images with questions. 

For example they could write I sore this yesterday and was not sure what it was. 

Other users can post answers to the questions about the images. Other users can upvote the comments and once the OP is happy with one of the answers he can choose to have the images solved
